# Granular Synthesis

_A complex sound may be imagined as a multicolored firework in which each point of light appears and instantaneously disappears against a black sky … A line of light would be created by a sufficiently large multitude of points appearing and disappearing instantaneously. (Xenakis 1992 pp. 43-44)_

Granular synthesis consists of combining a large number of tiny audio units (grains) over time, resulting in complex sound structures. Despite the origins of this concept being theoretically present way back, it was only after Dennis Gabor and Iannis Xenakis experiments that this kind of synthesis became more well funded. Then, Curtis Roads took granular concepts and applied them with computational models and we were left with a completely new kind of sound synthesis, capable of new timbres and sonic atmospheres.

With granular, instead of playing a sound file in a continuous linear way, we can divide that same sound file into thousands of micro pieces, modify them (pitch, amplitude and duration) and reorganize them in any way we want. Then we can play them individually at any rate, ranging from slow reading (generating discrete, noisy sounds), to very fast reading (generating very dense sonic atmospheres). From a single audio file we can generate a multitude of sounds with different characteristics, maintaining more or less the timbral characteristics of the original file or even creating completely new and original sounds that have no resemblance with its source.

This synthesis offers a lot of control to the user, since we’re dealing with individual grains, each one having its characteristics. Modifying one parameter can have a huge effect on the overall sound.

This kind of engine is the main focus of FRMS so there are plenty of granular controls and a lot of sound files to choose from. Simplicity and clarity was accounted for, so the controls are all visible (through buttons and knobs) and the granular gains are being graphically displayed so there’s a visual representation of what's creating the sound.
