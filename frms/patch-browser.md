# FRMS Help - Patches

The patch browser is divided in three columns: **Banks**, **Patches** and **Filter**. Three banks are available by default:

- **Factory** - This bank stores the default presets included in FRMS
- **Favorites** - presets you marked as favorite
- **Local** - This bank stores the presets saved by the user in the local machine.
- **Cloud** - The bank where your saved presets will be store on the cloud \(This bank is available when you have a profile account\).

_Note_: local bank is stored under Documents/Imaginando/FRMS/local.json and all the local resource files are store in Resources directory in the same path.

_Note_: All registered users have access to a free cloud sync plan for a maximum of 5 documents on the cloud. Paid plans with larger capacity are available. For more information, check your dashboard.
