# FM Synthesis

    A new application of the well-known process of frequency modulation is shown to result in a surprising control of audio spectra. The technique provides a means of great simplicity to control the spectral components and their evolution in time. Such dynamic spectra are diverse in their subjective impressions and include sounds both known and unknown. (Chowning 1973 The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation)

1973 was the year John Chowning released he’s paper about fm synthesis. There he stated that, despite being a known method for other applications, frequency modulation applied to sound could result in new rich sounds. With this synthesis method, one could even “replicate” other instruments using only sinusoidal waveforms. 

Contrary to subtractive synthesis, which modifies the spectral content of an harmonic rich sound, fm synthesis creates new spectral content that is modulated over time, by modulating an oscillator’s frequency (carrier) with the output’s amplitude of other oscillator (modulator). With this, even using simple sounds as a sine wave, it is possible to create complex ones, because when applying frequency modulation, new side bands emerge, thus resulting in new timbres.

The relationship between the frequencies of modulator and carrier (also known as ratio) is what is going to define the quality of the resulting sound. If that relation is harmonic, it will result in an harmonic sound. Otherwise, if the relationship is inharmonic, the resulting sound will be inharmonic too. The more the modulator’s frequency is increased, the more the resulting sound complexity. This concept is very important, since this relation is what will define the type of the resulting sound (bell like sounds have a specific ratio while woodwind sounds have another).

It is possible to have a chain of frequency modulations, where for example, oscillator one modulates oscillator two, and the result of oscillator two will modulate oscillator 3. This is just an example since there are a lot of different layout possibilities depending on the amount of oscillators available and each of those oscillators can be called an operator. Since FRMS has a system with 4 independent layers, it is possible to think of each one as an operator. In FRMS case, an operator can not only be an oscillator, but also a granulator engine, turning everything even more interesting. There are 8 different layouts available and each operator, if working as a modulator, has an available fm knob to control the amount of amplitude being sent as a modulation signal.

Available FM modes (each number corresponds to the layer number):
