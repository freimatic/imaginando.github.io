## **Envelope Panel**

This is the envelope panel. There are two independent envelopes that can be used. EG1 is used to shape the amplitude of the sound, and EG2 controls the layer's filter by default (using EG2 Knob), still, both can be used as modulators and have the same parameters to be controlled.

- **LINK Button** - When active, the two EG's are linked, so changes made affects both of them.

- **INV Button** - This button inverts the shape of the EG vertically.

- **SYNC Button** - When on, EG values are relative to the bpm.

- **ATTACK Knob** - Controls the attack time of the envelope.

- **CURVE Knob** - Controls the type of CRUVE being applied to the attack stage.

- **DECAY Knob** - Controls the decay time of the envelope.

- **CURVE Knob** - Controls the type of curve being applied to the decay stage.

- **SUSTAIN Knob** - Controls the sustain amount of the envelope.

- **RELEASE Knob** - Controls the release time of the envelope.

- **CURVE Knob** - Controls the type of curve being applied to the release stage.

- **ALT Button** - When pressed, this button switches the CURVE buttons to MAX buttons.

- **MAX Knob** - Controls the maximum time that can be applied to the envelope parameter laying on it's left.

- **A.VEL Knob** - Controls the amount of modulation being applied to the attack stage by velocity value.

- **R.VEL Knob** - Controls the amount of modulation being applied to release stage.

The panel with the drawed EG can be manipulated directly. It's possible to change the attack, decay, sustain, release, and the respective curve by making left/right and up/down movements.
