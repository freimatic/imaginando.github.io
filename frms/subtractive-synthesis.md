# Subtractive Synthesis

Despite the main focus of FRMS being the granular engine, it is possible to use each layer as an oscillator source. Subtractive synthesis is based on the sculpting of rich and complex waveforms, through the process of filtering and modulation. The name of subtractive comes from the fact that we start with full spectral waveforms, and we can manipulate them with the removal of its harmonic content, generating different timbral sounds all coming from the same source. With this in mind, we offer 4 kinds of waveforms:
Sawtooth - This waveform is the richest classic periodic waveform because it is composed of all harmonics of its fundamental.
Square and Triangle - These two waveforms is composed only be odd harmonics
Sinusoidal - The simplest and purest waveform. A sinusoidal is composed with only a single fundamental, having no harmonics.
Thereâ€™s also 5 types of filters to control the spectral content of each waveform.
