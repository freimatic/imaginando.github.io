# Layers

FRMS consists of 4 layers that can be used simultaneously or individually as an oscillator or granulator and each one has a distinctive color so it can be easily recognizable.

Each layer can be thought of as an instrument on its own. They can be summed together or used as an FM operator. [Learn more about FM in the global panel section.](global-panel)

With this architecture, the sonic possibilities are expanded because a single sound can have all the best characteristics of each mode. For example, it is possible to have a granular sound, with a low end constant sine tone, and some high distorted FM harmonics all at once. Despite the granular being the main focus of this instrument, with this approach it is possible to achieve and complement some sounds that in another way will require more time or different instruments to become available.

With this layering system, FM synthesis becomes very fluent and easy to achieve, because regardless of a layer being an oscillator or a granulator, it will function as an operator. It is only necessary to enable the FM engine, select the desired FM mode, and control the amount of FM being applied by the desired layers. In this way, instead of modulating only oscillators, it is also possible to modulate a granular layer by an oscillator or vice-versa.

Combining these engines (and also not forgetting the possibilities offered by the modulations) transforms FRMS in an instrument capable of producing amazing rich and complex sounds, with a high degree of versatility for all kinds of music, inspiration and sound goals.

There are two layer panels which means that you can work on two layers at the same time (without being constantly toggling between them if the lock function is disable. See below).

On the top left of each layer panel container you will find the following controls:

- **Layer selector** - Choose between four available layers numbered from 1 to 4. The colored number represents the current selected layer.

- **Lock** - Locks the upper view with the bottom view. Eg: When you select a layer on the top view, it will automatically set the same layer on the bottom view.

- **COPY** - Copies all layer parameters state to memory (excluding waveform)

- **PASTE** - Pastes all layer parameters in memory to the current layer (excluding waveform).
