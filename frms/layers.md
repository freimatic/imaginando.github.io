# Layers

FRMS consists of 4 layers that can be used simultaneously or individually as an oscillator or granulator and each one has a distinctive color so it can be easily recognizable.

Each layer can be thought of as an instrument on its own. They can be summed together or used as an FM operator. [Learn more about FM in the global panel section.](panel-global)

There are two layer panels which means that you can work on two layers at the same time (without being constantly toggling between them if the lock function is disable. See below).

On the top left of each layer panel container you will find the following controls:

- **Layer selector** - Choose between four available layers numbered from 1 to 4. The colored number represents the current selected layer.

- **Lock Icon** - Locks the upper view with the bottom view. Eg: When you select a layer on the top view, it will automatically set the same layer on the bottom view.

- **COPY Button** - Press it to copy all layer parameters state to memory (excluding waveform)

- **PASTE Button** - Press it to paste all layer parameters in memory to the current layer (excluding waveform).

[See next how to use the waveform panel.](waveform-panel)
