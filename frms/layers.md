# FRMS Help - Layers

FRMS consists of 4 layers that can be used as either an oscillator or granulator, with the controls of each layer colour coded for ease of use.

Each layer can be thought of as an individual instrument. They can be summed together or used as an FM operator. [Learn more about FM in the global panel section.](global-panel)

With this architecture, the sonic possibilities are expanded because each FRMS patch can use any combination of the available synthesis modes. For example, it is possible to combine a granular sound, with a low-end, constant, sine tone, and some high, distorted FM harmonics all at once. Despite granular synthesis being the main focus of FRMS, by mixing together the various synthesis types, you can generate interesting, complex and unique sounds that would otherwise require multiple instruments to achieve.

With this layering system, FM synthesis becomes very fluent and easy to achieve, because regardless of whether a layer is an oscillator or a granulator, it will function as an operator. It is only necessary to enable the FM engine, select the desired FM mode, and control the amount of FM being applied by the desired layers. In this way, instead of modulating only oscillators, it is also possible to modulate a granular layer using an oscillator or vice-versa.

There are two layer panels which means that you can work on two layers at the same time (without constantly toggling between them if the lock function is disabled - See below).

On the top left of each layer panel container you will find the following controls:

- **Layer selector** - Choose between four available layers numbered from 1 to 4. The colored number represents the currently selected layer.

- **Lock** - Locks the upper view with the bottom view. Eg: When you select a layer on the top view, it will automatically display the same layer on the bottom view.

- **COPY** - Copies the state of all layer parameters to memory (excluding waveform)

- **PASTE** - Pastes all layer parameters in memory to the current layer (excluding waveform).
