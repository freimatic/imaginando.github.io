# Overview

LK is divided in several different modules that can work along or independently of each other. These can be purchased separately, allowing you to mold **LK** to your needs.

Available modules:

- **Matrix** - Ableton Live session view controller.

- **MIDI Controller** - generic MIDI controller module.
- **XY/Pad** - KAOSS style X/Y midi controller.
