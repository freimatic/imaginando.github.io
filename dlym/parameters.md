Parameters

'**Chorus**' can be described as an attempt to emulate the phase interactions produced by two instrumentalists playing the same piece of music, on the same instrument, at the same time, with all of the fluctuations in pitch and timing expected. A chorus effect unit achieves this effect by adding a slight delay to the audio input, whilst also dynamically changing the delay time, pitch and amplitude of the effect, also known as modulation.

**Phaser** and **Flanger** share the same fundamental theory as **Chorus** but have subtle differences in the way that they are generated. Based on the concept of dual tape players, Flangers use a time delay circuit, whereas phasers use a phase shift circuit.

**DLYM** offers the ability to create all of the above effect styles using the following parameters/controls:

* **TIME** - the time length of the delay. The longer the time, the more pronounced the delay sync of the effect is.

* **FEEDBACK** - the amount of delay feedback. How much of the delay effect is fed back into the delay processing

* **RATE** - the rate of modulation \(for one complete cycle of the modulation waveform\)

* If **SYNC** is set to **OFF** the value is measured in milliseconds

* If **SYNC** is set to **ON** the value is measured in beat division steps

* **SYNC** - if set to **ON** the modulation waveform speed will sync to the host tempo of the DAW.

* **DEPTH** - the amount of modulation that affects the delay time.

* **WAVE** - the waveform shape used for modulation \(Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Triangle, Sample & Hold or Filtered Sample & Hold\)

* **MODE** - choose from 2 modes: 'Analog emulation' \(**ANA**\) and 'Dimension style' \(**DIM**\)

* **SPREAD** - the amount of stereo widening applied to the effect \(left is fully mono, right is full stereo\)

* **CROSSOVER** - controls the cutoff frequency to which the effect is applied. Fully left will use all frequencies, then moving the control clockwise/right raises the minimum frequency that will be affected by the plugin. Using this feature you can preserve the transients and phase of the low-end/bass frequencies, to ensure your overall mix keeps all of its weight and 'punchiness'.

* **DRY/WET** - the mix of unprocessed \(dry\) and processed \(wet\) audio output
