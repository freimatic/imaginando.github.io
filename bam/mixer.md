This panel is BAM’s full project mixer, providing access to mixing
controls for all tracks on one screen. Each track includes gain fader,
rotary control of A and B sends, and stereo pan, mute and solo buttons,
plus visual representation of track audio levels.

You can access additional functions for some tools by using them with
the SHIFT button pressed which is on the bottom right corner of the app.

You can also access FX processing for master and A/B return channels
above the MIXER when the MASTER track is selected:

Here we have a crop of 3 channels of BAM´s Mixer functionality with the
VU meters working. As you can see the VU meter on the first channel is
red since its gain peak value is over the 0dB mark. The channels peak
value is represented by the two lines above the filled VU meter while
the filled VU meter corresponds to the RMS value of the track.
