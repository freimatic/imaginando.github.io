BAMâ€™s project manager has a simple 3-column layout; Banks on the left,
projects in the center, and a genre tag/filter on the right.

To open and close the project manager, click the project name on the top
toolbar.

The default three banks are:

- **Factory** - a selection of demo projects

- **Local** - the default bank to save custom projects to device local
    storage

- **Favorites** - provides a shortcut to all starred/favorited
    projects
