This Panel is used to manage all the MIDI mappings configured on your
BAM project. Here can see and edit the list of the parameters mapped to
MIDI.

There are two way of adding parameters to this list:
- Press MIDI learn on the TOP Section of BAM, choose the parameter to add and then interact with the MIDI device you want it mapped to
- Press the configure button and choose the parameter you want to add (hosted version only)

When BAM is working on a hosted version and you need to expose the
parameters of BAM on the host to be able to automate, just press the
configure button and then press the parameter you want to automate. The
order of the parameters on the Host application will be the same as the
one the Mappings Manager.

To edit the MIDI mapped parameters, with the MIDI Learn On double click
the mapped parameter you want to edit and a pop-up window will appear
allowing you to choose if you want the mapping to be either a CC or a
NOTE and then you can choose the MIDI channel and either the
corresponding CC or NOTE you want it assigned to.
