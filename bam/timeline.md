This panel functions like a step sequencer. Each one of the 16 tracks
can have different step sequencer configurations from size to playback
speed to directions etc…

Here you can write/delete notes on steps. Each step represents a 16th
note, with the default clip length containing 16 steps but can be
expanded to a maximum of 256 steps through the buttons described with
the letters (I) and (M). Next to the name of the track you have a
display of the number of Steps for the corresponding track. If the
playback speed of the clip is set to 1 (normal speed), each step is ¼ of
the project's tempo. You can change time signatures, playback speed and
direction as well as swing for each track. It is also possible to loop
the playback of specific sections of each track’s clip.

When you mark a step with a note, the value of the note can be defined in three different ways, and these are:
- the note default value that is chosen on the note value of the Trigger Device
- the note value defined by an automation value on the step in the Automations Panel
- If any notes are being pressed on a MIDI keyboard or on the BAM´s keyboard while writing on a step, - that will be the value of the note written. If more than one key is pressed a chord will be written.


You can access additional functions for some tools by using them with
the SHIFT button pressed which is on the bottom right corner of the app.
