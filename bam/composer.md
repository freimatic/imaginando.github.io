The Composer view displays an environment with a Piano Roll keyboard on
the left side and its timeline on the right side which allows you to
create and edit the contents of the Matrix clips with various tools.

All note actions are applied to currently selected notes or to all notes
if no notes are selected. Manually created notes will always be snapped
to the grid. To create notes just click where you want the notes to be
created. If you click and drag you can create a long note. If you click
on an already existing note and drag this will move the note, but if you
click and drag the right end of a note it will change duration. (On iOS
you can zoom the view using two fingers). To make a selection of notes
you can click on an empty space and drag diagonally to create an area of
selection.

You can access additional functions for some tools by using them with
the SHIFT button active.
