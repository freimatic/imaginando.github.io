# DRC Help - Troubleshooting

** DRC is telling me I need to purchase the software but i have already purchased (mobile only).**

1. **Try to restore purchase** - Ensure that you have your device configured with the same account you have made the purchase with. Open DRC, open menu, choose Store, tap Restore Purchases.

2. **Restore purchases doesn't do nothing** - Sometimes, in some devices, Restore Purchases is not working. If this happens, choose to purchase the same item (you won't be charged again).

3. **If any of the above don't work** - A way to solve this problem might be to log out of the app store in settings, re-log, reboot DRC and try to restore purchase again.
