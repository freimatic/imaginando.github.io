# Overview

DRC features a minimalistic interface designed to operate in the various screen sizes, ranging from mobile to desktop. The interface is divided in four parameters panels and a perform section. Each panel is composed of several tabs that allow access to other parameters in a easy and intuitive way.

The following features are found on the left side of **DRC**'s status bar:

- **Midi Learn** - toggle midi learn on and off
- **Tempo** - main session tempo
- **Patch** - indicates the currently selected patch. Tap it to open patch browser

## Midi learn

The Mapping feature of **DRC** allows the mapping of its parameters for remote control by a MIDI controller.

Toggle the MIDI Learn function by tapping it and **DRC**'s controls will get darker. When the desired mapping parameter is selected, it will get highlighted \(if the parameter doesn't have any assignment it will be labeled as N/A\).

Once a message from the MIDI Device is received, it will be mapped and displayed on **DRC**. Once you are done with the mappings, turn off MIDI Learn on the status bar and **DRC** is ready to operate with the given assignments.

## Tempo

The tempo setting, controls the value of **DRC**'s internal clock. If DRC is working in slave mode (as a plugin in a DAW or as a inter-app audio node), the tempo is defined by the host.

## Patch

Tapping here opens the patch browser where it is possible to navigate between the different banks of patches and select any of the available **DRC** patches.

## Status bar icons

On the right side of the status bar are 5 icons:

- **Disk**

- This opens the save menu where you can name/save the current patch state as either a new patch, or overwrite an existing one, in either the local or cloud bank.

- **Revert**

- This resets the current patch back to its original saved state. (This button is only active/available if changes have been made to a saved patch - to indicate this, an asterisk will appear to the right of the patch name.)

- **Random**

- When pressed this will assign a random value to each parameter.

- **Up arrow**

- This selects the previous patch from the list of patches in the currently selected bank.

- **Down arrow**

- This selects the next patch from the list of patches in the currently selected bank.
