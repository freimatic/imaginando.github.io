- **Quality** - The resolution at which each layer is rendered. The lower the value, the smoother the visual output. For a more detailed visual output try a higher resolution
- **Voices** - number of simultaneous polyphonic visual voices. Ex: With 4 polyphonic voices, each layer can display 4 simultaneous materials at once

**Note: If the frames per second counter is below the target frame rate, it means that your GPU is not capable of delivering the frame rate you request. If that is the case, you should lower the quality setting until fps reaches your target frame rate.**
